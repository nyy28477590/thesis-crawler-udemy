       "  '說明Welcome! This is Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Data Science Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python.One question or concern I get a lot is that people want to learn deep learning and data science, so they take these courses, but they get left behind because they don’t know enough about the Numpy stack in order to turn those concepts into code.Even if I write the code in full, if you don’t know Numpy, then it’s still very hard to read.This course is designed to remove that obstacle - to show you how to do things in the Numpy stack that are frequently needed in deep learning and data science.So what are those things?Numpy. This forms the basis for everything else. The central object in Numpy is the Numpy array, on which you can do various operations.The key is that a Numpy array isn’t just a regular array you’d see in a language like Java or C++, but instead is like a mathematical object like a vector or a matrix.That means you can do vector and matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.The most important aspect of Numpy arrays is that they are optimized for speed. So we’re going to do a demo where I prove to you that using a Numpy vectorized operation is faster than using a Python list.Then we’ll look at some more complicated matrix operations, like products, inverses, determinants, and solving linear systems.Pandas. Pandas is great because it does a lot of things under the hood, which makes your life easier because you then don’t need to code those things manually.Pandas makes working with datasets a lot like R, if you’re familiar with R.The central object in R and Pandas is the DataFrame.We’ll look at how much easier it is to load a dataset using Pandas vs. trying to do it manually.Then we’ll look at some dataframe operations useful in machine learning, like filtering by column, filtering by row, and the apply function.Pandas dataframes will remind you of SQL tables, so if you have an SQL background and you like working with tables then Pandas will be a great next thing to learn about.Since Pandas teaches us how to load data, the next step will be looking at the data. For that we will use Matplotlib.In this section we’ll go over some common plots, namely the line chart, scatter plot, and histogram.We’ll also look at how to show images using Matplotlib.99% of the time, you’ll be using some form of the above plots.Scipy.I like to think of Scipy as an addon library to Numpy.Whereas Numpy provides basic building blocks, like vectors, matrices, and operations on them, Scipy uses those general building blocks to do specific things.For example, Scipy can do many common statistics calculations, including getting the PDF value, the CDF value, sampling from a distribution, and statistical testing.It has signal processing tools so it can do things like convolution and the Fourier transform.In sum:If you’ve taken a deep learning or machine learning course, and you understand the theory, and you can see the code, but you can’t make the connection between how to turn those algorithms into actual running code, this course is for you.\"If you can\\'t implement it, you don\\'t understand it\"Or as the great physicist Richard Feynman said: \"What I cannot create, I do not understand\".My courses are the ONLY courses where you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratchOther courses will teach you how to plug in your data into a library, but do you really need help with 3 lines of code?After doing the same thing with 10 datasets, you realize you didn\\'t learn 10 things. You learned 1 thing, and just repeated the same 3 lines of code 10 times...Suggested Prerequisites:matrix arithmeticprobabilityPython coding: if/else, loops, lists, dicts, setsyou should already know \"why\" things like a dot product, matrix inversion, and Gaussian probability distributions are useful and what they can be used forWHAT ORDER SHOULD I TAKE YOUR COURSES IN?:Check out the lecture \"Machine Learning and AI Prerequisite Roadmap\" (available in the FAQ of any of my courses)此課程適合哪些人：Students and professionals with little Numpy experience who plan to learn deep learning and machine learning laterStudents and professionals who have tried machine learning and data science but are having trouble putting the ideas down in code顯示更多顯示更少'],\n",

I’m an award-winning professional speechwriter with more than fifteen years of experience writing for senior politicians in the United Kingdom and internationally – including for two former Prime Ministers. During my career I’ve written thousands of speeches to audiences across Europe and North America.I’ve written countless debates in the British Parliament. I’ve written articles for newspapers including The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, La Repubblica, El Pais, The Times and Die Welt. I’ve also written for magazines including Wired and Newsweek. I even had the honour of writing an historic and award-winning speech to a joint meeting of the United States Congress. In this course, I’ll give you the full benefit of my years of experience and expertise to set you on the path to writing success.5 STAR REVIEW - “I really enjoyed the course. Each lesson was interesting and full of examples. Mark is a real specialist in his field and it's clear that he is passionate about his work. You are not only listening to empty words but learning from someone's experience - which for me is the best way. Even now, writing this review, I am trying to implement what I have learnt - which is a good proof of this course being a 5 stars one.” A.A.This is not a technical course full of complex grammar. It focusses on the timeless principles that you can use to produce clear, powerful, persuasive writing.The course starts by looking at what good writing is and at the evidence as to why writing well is so important. The course is then divided into three main sections: before you write (planning), while you write (writing), and after you write (editing).Part One: Planning: In this section, I’ll show you what you need to do before you put pen to paper. We’ll ask the big questions you need to answer for everything you write:What is your objective? If you don’t know what you want, you’re unlikely to get it.Who is your reader? Only by understanding your reader and consciously writing for them can you achieve your objectives.What is your voice? Who or what do your words represent? Yourself, your boss, your company? Only by having a clear and consistent voice can you achieve your objectives.I’ll then show you how to plan and structure your work to lead your reader from where they are to where you want them to be.5 STAR REVIEW - “Loved this course! Mark gives you what you need to write in clear English. He goes directly to the point with his ideas, examples, and summaries. After doing this course, I started to see that my writing has improved. My sentences are shorter, cleaner, and more direct. I can't wait to continue to practice all learned in the course. Here's fresh news! Mark remastered the videos recently. Now, it's much more pleasant to watch and to listen. Go for it that you won't regret.” B.B.Part Two: Writing: In this second section, I’ll guide you through the building blocks of writing: words, sentences, paragraphs and the whole piece. I’ll show you how to choose the right words and put them in the best order so you can achieve your objectives.In this section you’ll learn techniques both ancient and modern that will turn your words into a powerful engine for achieving your goals. We’ll look at the logic and emotion of your words and at establishing credibility with your reader. I’ll also take you through many of the most common mistakes that people make in their writing, and how to avoid them.5 STAR REVIEW - “I loved the way he explained things, simple yet profound. Easy to understand; he lives up to his words. Highly recommended. Thank you so much.” BPart Three: Editing: In this section you’ll learn the vital art of editing. I’ll show you how to sharpen and smooth your first draft into something you can be truly proud of. I’ll show you how to test your words to see if they are clear, understandable and – most important - achieve your objectives.5 STAR REVIEW - “I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It was fully comprehensive and packed with valuable tips to improve any type of writing. The tutor obviously had a lot of writing experience and didn’t hold back in sharing his knowledge. I liked the way he explained how to deal with writer’s block as it sounds very effective. I’ll definitely use it the next time my head feels empty.” S.M.Finally, I’ll share some of the techniques I use to be a productive and successful writer. I’ll show you how you can enter a ‘State of Flow’, where excellent writing comes easily, and how you can avoid ever suffering from writer’s block.In each section, I’ll take you step-by-step through the techniques, tricks and habits that can transform your writing.If you want to promote your business, excel in your career, and feel proud of your writing, Better Business Writing is the course for you.So join tens of thousands of people already improving their writing skills and enroll now!此課程適合哪些人：This course is for everyone who writes at work.

You\\'ll also build trust and accountability without wasting time on useless technology tools, frustrating meetings or countless back & forth emails. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Remote teams are the future of workLearning how to manage people you don\\'t see face-to-face is an important skill that you need regardless of what industry you\\'re in. The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has accelerated the need for managing people who work from home, as telecommuting became the norm.With \"How to Manage & Influence Your Virtual Team\" you will learn the psychological secrets of persuasion and communication that influence your virtual team members to do what you need them to do. The course will also help you increase the level of trust and accountability among your team members while reducing the time you spend on frustrating meetings, useless technology tools, and back-and-forth emails. At the end of each lecture in the course, you\\'ll get specific, actionable steps that you can implement immediately. In addition, you\\'ll also get downloadable sample scripts and templates that you can simply copy & paste and use with your own virtual team. The course contains the following sections: The Psychology of Communication in Virtual Teams: Psychological strategies to effectively communicate with your team and reduce ambiguity and miscommunicationPrinciples of Behavior Change: Four strategic principles that will change your team\\'s behavior to get things doneTactics of Influence & Persuasion: Step-by-step tactics that influence your team members to do what you need them to doManaging Virtual Meetings Effectively: How to have fewer meetings while increasing their effectiveness at the same timeChoosing and Evaluating the Right Technology: A simple framework to choose and evaluate the right technology tools to use with your virtual teamsBuilding Trust in Virtual Environments: A methodical blueprint to increase the level of trust among your virtual teamKiller Email and Phone Techniques: Powerful email and phone techniques that you can use to influence your virtual team membersWhat is different about this course? There are many courses on managing virtual teams. Here are three reasons why this one is different Reason #1: Tactics, not just strategies Most courses about virtual teams focus on high-level strategies and theories. Very few actually give you the tactics that you need to implement those strategies. In this course, I\\'ll show you how to apply the management tactics to your own situation. You\\'ll get step-by-step techniques and scripts that will save you a lot of time in managing your virtual team. In other words, you will get answers to both those questions: -What do I need to do? -How do I do it? Moreover, every video also has a “Summary of Actions\" slide at the end that summarizes the course lecture for you, and tells you exactly what you need to do as a next step. Basically, you\\'ll learn everything about virtual team management in simple steps.Reason #2: Proven Science-based Research For the course, I did a ton of science-based research about powerful psychological and productivity studies in the areas of influence and management. Some of the research references include studies from the Harvard Business School, Kelley School of Business, and McKinsey Global Institute. I also reference studies from international bestselling books such as “Influence: The Science of Persuasion,\" “Made to Stick,\" and “The Tipping Point,\" among others. I\\'ve tested the findings from those references myself and selected what works and what doesn\\'t in virtual teams. So you will get the absolute best of the best concepts that work for you and your team. Reason #3: Practical insights that work (not just theory) I\\'ve been managing virtual teams for over 15 years, both as an entrepreneur and as a program manager. In fact, I still work as a remote leader, and my full-time job is to manage virtual teams across the world to deliver highly complex projects (note: I work for Cisco Systems, but all views are my own and not those of Cisco). Unlike most courses that are taught by professors who have studied this space from a purely theoretical view, you\\'ll be getting a unique perspective on how to manage people remotely from someone who does this for a living. In short, the course will help you: Communicate more effectively and build trust with your teamStop worrying about being caught up in pointless day-to-day detailsSave valuable time spent on useless meetings and back & forth emailsChoose the right technology tools and techniques for effective team collaborationInfluence your team to be accountable for getting tasks accomplishedNOTE for Project Management Professional (PMP) certification holders This course qualifies for 3 Professional Development Units (PDUs) under the Project Management Institute\\'s (PMI\\'s) \"Education\" requirement. After you\\'re done with the course, you will get a \"Certificate of Completion\" from Udemy, which you can use as evidence for PMI. All 3 hours can be claimed under the \"Leadership\" category.------------------------------------------------------------------------Student Testimonials:★★★★★ \"I\\'ve been managing virtual teams for three years and still found some great gems in this course! I especially liked the first three modules (Communication, Behavior Change, and Persuasion) as well as the Trust module.

Don\\'t overlook this auspicious opportunity...\" — JULIEN MCLAREN, UDEMY STUDENTThe world of “elite” writingGood writing isn’t just another nice-to-have ability. It’s one of the most important skills you need for conveying a professional image at work, landing a high-profile job, and getting your content noticed online.But while plenty of people can write, few can do so with pizzazz of top journalists, who know heaps of fancy tricks and tactics to make their writing rise above the ordinary.After taking this course, you’ll know their techniques.Imagine being able to leave readers spellbound by your writing, the same as one might feel after reading a gripping story in a top newspaper like The Economist.In this course, Shani teaches you how to craft such impossibly beautiful prose by revealing not only the vital ingredients of good nonfiction writing, but also the mindset of the many elite writers he has worked with and also trained — the finer points they obsess over, the writing habits they cultivate, and the core values they uphold.“If Shani Raja was a baseball player, he hit the ball out of the park. The curriculum, into which he obviously poured years of successful writing and editing know-how, is comprehensive, engaging and experiential…” — JEAN, UDEMY STUDENTOnce your mindset has been shaped, Shani will reveal the four “ingredients” of exceptional writing in all their glory — showing that simplicity, clarity, elegance and evocativeness are the only qualities needed to create punchy, sharp, graceful and captivating copy.Shani has used this powerful formula to train journalists in top news organisations, as well as to boost the writing ability of his hundreds of thousands of Udemy students.Soon, you will also know how to magically enhance your own blogs, essays, books, business writing — or any other type of nonfiction prose.THE COURSE COMES WITH A 30-DAY, NO-QUESTIONS-ASKED, FULL MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE, SO THERE IS NO RISK IN ENROLLING TODAY AND SEEING IF IT’S FOR YOU.So, join the hundreds of thousands of students who’ve already invested in discovering these and many more powerful writing secrets from an accomplished editor.\"Better than any course I took in college...\" — ANNA TIERNEY, UDEMY STUDENT“There are twenty courses in my Udemy folder, of which seventeen are in some genre of writing.

And if you apply yourself well, you won’t fail to emerge a better and more confident writer.The best editors on the planetWriting With Flair is the first in a series of programs designed to supercharge your writing ability. It is truly a foundational course that others — including Ninja Writing and Editing Mastery — build upon.You’ll learn, for instance, how to develop the mindset of a standout writer, which includes guidance on how to write with integrity, to care deeply for your readers, and to approach your copy with a clear awareness of your intent — among other gems.Also, this updated version of the course comes equipped with an editing workbook, neat lecture summaries, “live” edits, and suggestions for further reading.

He wanted to add \"SQL\" as a skill to his resume/CV with a clean conscience and back it up if any questions arose in the interview. But getting there would take forever. Better to just \"fake it til\\' you make it\"... right? Joe was working in a marketing position at a small company. He had a bunch of creative ideas but sometimes felt like he was shooting in the dark and guessing at what customers were doing. If only he had some insights about user behavior so he could be a more data-driven marketer. But data analysis is only for technical folks… right? Our Story: David and Pete joined Udemy with little to no technical experience. But after a lot of trial and error, headaches, and help from their friends, they got good enough to uncover unique insights for themselves, their team, and their company using SQL. They were able to discover interesting things about user behavior, create dashboards to track and measure progress on team goals, pull data for the exec team to use in investor pitch decks, and get data driven about decisions they made. They\\'ve since helped many team members buff up their data analysis skills and helped students land jobs! What You\\'ll Learn: If you have no technical background, don\\'t be afraid! We\\'ve distilled our knowledge and experience using SQL into a short course so that by the end, you\\'ll have the raw skills to do some real data analysis for your company using SQL - a language virtually EVERY company uses. Note: this courses teaches you real-world SQL - not just the theory in abstract, but real skills you can use to get more data-driven in your current job.

No abstract/theoretical mumbo jumbo.We\\'ll go through queries a real business would run while also teaching you the raw skills undergirding those queries so you can adapt those skills to create custom queries for your own specific purposesTo reinforce learning, we have exercises and quizzes scattered throughout the course so you can learn by doingWe\\'ll have a bonus section where new lectures will be added occasionally (including student-requested lectures, more advanced topics, strategies for getting unstuck, etc.)We\\'ll be actively involved in the discussion board answering any questions you might have! Don\\'t be afraid to ask! A Note About Pedagogy: We know what it\\'s like to buy a book, feel good about yourself, never finish it and have nothing to show for it. We don\\'t want that to happen with this course. We want this to be a course you\\'ll actually finish. We believe half of learning is motivation and engagement, so we\\'ve tried extra hard to make this course fun, relevant, entertaining, and punchy - no frills, no dragging things out, just the good stuff.

You\\'ll know exactly how to get your writing noticed.In Ninja Writing, you will discover how to embed quality at EVERY LAYER of your writing—whether it’s a blog, article, college essay, cover letter, corporate report or content marketing.By the end, you’ll appreciate exactly how one piece of writing can be strikingly beautiful while another—on the same subject—bores you to tears.\"Up to this point, you\\'ve probably been bored with so many writing teachers who emphasize \\'structure\\' through grammar tips and organization with a shot of word selection. But Shani covers that missing component: the artistry of writing. Writing can be just as fulfilling as painting, drawing or designing...\" -- SANDY, UDEMY STUDENT \"Even my degree did not teach me to write at these levels...\" -- YAP WAN XIANG, UDEMY STUDENTSo, what exactly is a ninja writer?It\\'s someone who can take disjointed thoughts and ideas and create beautiful narratives out of them.That is the hallmark of a distinguished writer: one who understands how to build points elegantly, wrap them into neatly arranged sections, and then thread the ideas through exquisitely organized paragraphs.A ninja writer has mastery over the sentence layer of writing as well.He or she instinctively understands how to tighten loose sentences, sharpen blurred ones, and bring rhythm to those that don\\'t flow well.Finally, ninja writers wield invincible power over words. They’re able to bring color, variety and freshness into their writing through their word choices, while slicing away any that have lost their edge or carry dead weight.While a bad writer can make a mess even of the most sublime thinking, a ninja writer’s prose—blogs, essays, or any kind of business writing—always ends up looking spectacularly polished.The fact is that great writing isn’t just a nice skill to have. It’s vital to conveying intelligence and professionalism to your bosses, clients, business partners, and blog or book readers.Frankly, if you don\\'t have this part of your life handled, you\\'ll probably get fewer career chances, less shots at a promotion, and not as many eyeballs online.And instinctively you know it.If you’re a blogger, the world may miss out on your brilliant ideas, simply because your writing is too dull or unwieldy to take seriously. Remember that we live in the internet age, where a growing army of writers are competing to get noticed in an expanding sea of content.This course will give you an edge. It’ll quickly take your writing to a level of refinement that will mystify anybody who doesn’t know these elite techniques.Here\\'s a chance to take your writing to a level that, honestly, blows your competition out of the water.\"All I can say is WOW! After only a few lessons I went from struggling to write fewer than five hundred coherent words in two hours to easily churning out well written, well thought out content in less than 20 minutes.\" -- LISA THOMPSON, UDEMY STUDENT Just the understanding that writing has four layers can make a huge difference to how effectively you communicate.If you don\\'t know anything about those layers yet, don’t fret.Only a handful of writers do, and many are editors who work, as I have done, for top news organizations.They spend all day bringing order and beauty to whatever article is presented to them.They know how to focus on areas that bring structure to untidy prose, and a razor-sharp focus to disorderly ideas.I know how rare this skill is because until recently I was an editor at The Wall Street Journal, where I taught many of the newspaper\\'s journalists how to add style, flair and potency to their articles. I\\'ve also written for The Economist, Financial Times, Bloomberg News and other highly regarded news institutions.In Ninja Writing, I share what I’ve learned at those places under the mentorship of some of the best editors in the world.Once you\\'ve learned their secrets, you too will be able to weave magic with your words.You\\'ll know how to create spellbinding narratives, breathe life into tired sentences, and dazzle readers with the words you choose.You\\'ll also write with more confidence.\"My writing has dramatically improved...\" -- LYNN, UDEMY STUDENT\"Can’t wait to use all the tricks and techniques...\" -- ADAPERIO, UDEMY STUDENT\"The Strunk and White guide for today\\'s world... sure to be a classic...\" -- DERRICK HOWELL, UDEMY STUDENTOne of the biggest problems novice writers have is not knowing if their writing is any good.That won’t be a problem for you anymore.You’ll know that it is.Ninja Writing: The Four Levels Of Writing Mastery takes the mystery out of the writing process.The tricks and tactics taught here will create a seismic shift in the quality of your writing, almost immediately.You’ll express yourself as brilliantly as some of the slickest editors on the planet.You’ll understand how to turn any kind of mediocre business writing into masterful prose.The content here goes beyond what is taught in Writing With Flair: How To Become An Exceptional Writer, one of Udemy’s best-selling courses.In Writing With Flair, I gave you a powerful framework for creating outstanding writing based on the three principles of simplicity, clarity and elegance.The sweep of Ninja Writing: The Four Levels Of Writing Mastery is much broader.It covers the whole territory of nonfiction writing, giving you a ground-up-and-top-down view of what’s needed to inject quality into EVERY PORE of your writing.If Writing With Flair turned you into an exceptional writer, Ninja Writing will mould you further into an elite one.Like my other courses, Ninja Writing steers clear of needlessly complicated jargon. You’ll simply get strategies to help you write with impeccable style and poise.The course has been designed to help you reach the top of the learning curve in as little as a few days.You’ll discover ways of looking at your writing that will elevate it to a plane most others don’t even know exists.In Ninja Writing, I reveal the four levels of writing mastery you must work to perfect.THE NARRATIVE LEVELHow to connect with your audience, organize your writing magnificently, start your piece with a bang, end with a flourish, and embed it with powerful imagery. Getting the structure right is one of the hardest skills to master, but I\\'ll make it super easy for you in this section.THE PARAGRAPH LEVELHow to weave points through paragraphs, so your writing looks exceptionally ordered and polished.

       "  '說明DescriptionFrom our personal to our professional lives, corporations to governments, individuals to nations, projects are the new reality. Welcome to the Project Revolution!The emergence of projects as the economic engine of our times is silent but incredibly disruptive and powerful.Projects are timeless and universal. The construction of the pyramids in Egypt, the development of modern cities, the Marshall Plan, the Apollo space programme, the creation of the European Union – all these achievements were the result of ideas being turned into reality through projects. Project-based work is the engine that generates the major accomplishments of our civilization; it has stimulated society to advance and often go beyond long-established scientific and cultural limits.Projects change the world. Projects make impossible dreams possible.The behavioural and social sciences endorse the idea that there are a few ways of working and collaborating that are particularly motivating and inspiring for people working on a project. These are that a project should have ambitious goals, a higher purpose and a clear deadline. You have probably noticed that what people tend to remember most clearly from their entire careers is the projects they work on – often the successful ones, but also the failed ones.According to recent research, the number of individuals working in project-based roles will increase from 66 million (in 2017) to 88 million (forecast 2027). And the value of economic activity worldwide that is project oriented will grow from $12 trillion (in 2013) to $20 trillion (forecast 2027). Those are millions of projects requiring millions of project managers per year.My prediction is that by 2025, regardless of the industry or sector, senior leaders and managers will spend at least 60% of their time selecting, prioritizing and driving the execution of projects. We will all become project leaders – despite never having been trained to be so!Here are some of the areas we will cover in my course:Understand how the project revolution is dramatically impacting the way organizations sell their products.Learn how Philips and Nike will change the way the bring their products to market.Explore a framework that can be used by anyone to succeed in projects and turn ideas into reality.Learn how strategic thinking is what differentiates great leaders from good leaders.Overview of some of the most relevant strategy concepts and definitions of project management.Learn the most frequent challenges you may face when trying to think strategically.Explore the most agile organizations that are faster to market, implement strategic thinking and good decision making.Learn how to close a project, how to bring the project to an end and how to ensure that the benefits are captured.And much more!此課程適合哪些人：Curious individuals in for- and non-profit organizations who want to increase their strategic contribution and grow the success of their projectsEntrepreneurs looking for a simple approach to better their start-up projects successProject Managers, Engineers, Strategic thinkers who desire to be a great leader!Finally, this course is also appropriate for people working in any industry who want to progress in their careers顯示更多顯示更少'],\n",

       "  '說明WARNING: This course is not for everyone. You should only consider this course if you want to expand your mind, reveal and overcome unconscious bias, and improve relationships, productivity, morale and diversity in every area of work and life. If that is you, then keep reading.Do you ever feel like you judge people too fast?You see them in the grocery store or during an interview and your mind lights up like fireworks. They’re too fat, too skinny, too tall, too short, too ugly, too pretty, too clean, too inked, too tough, too weak, too stupid, too smart, too rich, too poor, too old, too young.Everyone has those thoughts.The problem is they block you from discovering who that person really is. They stop you from asking yourself what they might be like on the inside. So you avoid them. You skip them for jobs. You never ask about their story and you miss out on valuable relationships.And the bigger problem is you only engage with those who fit your idea of how a person “should” be. So you create a circle of influence around you that lacks diversity, open communication, and growth. All of that holds you back in untold ways in business and life.You Can’t Change Other People But You CAN Change YourselfYour instincts never change, and you can’t force others to be different either. But that doesn’t mean you can’t adjust your own habits to lift yourself up to new horizons where you can see the world, and other people from different and more useful perspectives.With a bit of effort and minor adjustments, you can begin to realize old, ineffective thought patterns and replace them with new, more useful tools and behaviors.What Are Unconscious Biases?Unconscious biases are perspectives you hold that form automatically based on a variety of information sources from the world around you.They’re kind of like what happens when someone throws a ball at your face. Your hands automatically fly up to protect your head. Unconscious biases are a type of automatic, instinctual self-defense mechanism as well.When you see someone with tattoos and you judge them as “bad” or “trouble,” you might avoid them because your bias told you they’re no good. Sometimes that judgment might be right. But what about when it isn’t?What if that person is the nicest, friendliest, most loyal and trustworthy human on the planet? What if they hold the key to the biggest opportunity of your life? Too bad. You will never know, because you judged them incorrectly and you did it automatically.Is This a Corporate Problem Too?Unconscious bias is a problem for everyone, and when it enters the workplace, it digs a pit of despair for businesses. Human Resources, recruiters, and anyone who hires or works together will likely face the challenges of unconscious bias.The problem is, it leads to weakness in the business. It’s like building a castle on a foundation of toothpicks. Without accounting for unconscious bias, you end up with a workforce made of people who were judged “good enough” based on shallow social cues, rather than the value they can actually provide.Ultimately, you create an environment that lacks diversity, innovation, and any kind of creative thought at all. In this course, I’ll show you how and when to say, “So what?” so you can see beyond those biases to find, recruit and grow the best team and company possible!What Will You Learn in this Course?In this course, my goal is to help you begin to recognize different kinds of biases in your life. Together, we will review types of biases most people don’t know exist. We will also work to help you overcome those biases in your own life so you gain perspective, insight and the ability to make conscious choices that serve you better.Inside You Will Discover:A Powerful Way to Test Your Unconscious Bias to Reveal Your Hidden WeaknessesSeveral Sneaky Unconscious Biases that Wreak Havoc on Every Decision in LifeThe Most Devastating Impacts of Bias in Your Personal & Professional DevelopmentSimple, Profound Exercises to Help You Reframe Your Perspective OvernightTools to Help You Communicate More Clearly, Improve Productivity and DiversityHow to Create Your Own Story and an Action Plan for Exponential ChangeWho Am I?I’m Gail Miller, and I’ve spent decades disrupting stale corporate policies, beliefs, and unconscious biases. I’m featured on TEDx and various media outlets. I’ve served in HR and corporate recruiting for more than 20 years. Over the course of my career I’ve helped countless companies and individuals transform into leaders who stand up for what is right and have the courage to rebel against unconscious bias that restrains relationships, progress and performance in business and life.Enjoy Free ResourcesWhen you enroll in this course, you’ll find a plethora of useful resources, tools and case studies to help you in your journey to overcome unconscious bias. As new knowledge becomes available, I’m committed to making updates so you have the latest information to help you go forward and accomplish your goals.Are You Ready to Overcome Unconscious Bias?If any of this made you stop and think, “Holy crap! I’m probably dealing with unconscious bias and this is the change I need!” then scroll up and enroll in Unconscious Bias: Fuel Diversity and Become a Better You now!Sincerely,Gail MillerFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSQ - Why does unconscious bias matter?A - Unconscious bias permeates every aspect of human life and it can really undermine your personal progress, and lead you to miss fantastic opportunities. In the corporate space it destroys diversity. In worst case scenarios unconscious bias can even be the difference between life and death.Q - Is it really possible to defeat unconscious bias?A - Yes, and though you can’t completely eradicate it, you can always strive to make better decisions that enhance your life. It’s an ongoing process, and this course is a good place to begin your journey.Q - Does this course apply to routine life or just to corporate culture?A - Much of my background involves the corporate environment, but everything you’ll learn in this course is useful throughout all areas of life.Q - What kind of person should take this course?A - You should enroll in this course if you want to improve yourself and the world around you by overcoming limiting beliefs, snap judgments, and unconscious biases that filter the world through negative lenses for you.Q - Is this course useful for HR, Recruiters, Hiring Managers, and Executives?A - Yes, of course. There are practical solutions to overcoming unconscious bias in your company to improve diversity, inclusion, hiring, corporate culture, customer relations revenue and much more.

       "  '說明Why Security Awareness?Data breaches are on the rise and it\\'s getting more and more dangerous to function online. This is where a good security awareness program is important. Most importantly, we (the nerds) need YOU to help keep things secure.That\\'s right. Security is more than an IT or Security department function and we haven\\'t been as good at communicating that to you in the past.You may hear professionals claim how everyone is getting compromised over simple attacks that have been around for decades. It starts off as something that\\'s easy to prevent then launches into an intelligence war. \"It\\'s easy to protect yourself,\" some may claim. \"All you need to do is be careful what you download, who you talk to, and what you allow to happen.\" They give off the vibe that people don\\'t care.If you boil everything down to its most basic essence, then maybe that could be true. If it\\'s so easy then why do we continue to get hammered with news of more breaches?Unfortunately, even the best security awareness programs out there are missing one key part. The WHY.Making Security Awareness BetterThis security awareness training course will not only give you the \"what\" to look out for, but also the \"why\" and how the \"what\" works. After taking this course you\\'ll be armed with knowledge on how to better protect yourself and your organization from threats.Surprisingly, the biggest change will probably not be to start doing, but rather to stop doing. You\\'ll be surprised to how some of your behavior is super risky, even without you realize you were doing it.And the best part is, I won\\'t twist your arm or shame you into changing. I sincerely want you to succeed so there\\'s no victim shaming here. I believe there\\'s a better way to change your behavior than vehemently shove security terms and nerd speak down your throat.This Security Awareness Course IS:a security awareness course meaning it\\'s information and awareness based. We\\'re going to be looking at the \"what,\" the \"why,\" and some behaviors.essentially a computer and Internet safety training course.for anyone at work who has a security awareness training requirement.for home users who simply want to learn more about internet security and privacy.This Security Awareness Course is NOT:a technical or operational security guide.a technically charged course with jargon that only your IT or Security department would understand.Since this course is NOT technical, beginners ranging form your co-worker that barely knows how to turn a computer on to your Grandma that uses Facebook too much can take and understand this course. We\\'re simply looking at threats, attack vectors, and behaviors to help reduce the sting of attacks.Real Reviews From Amazing StudentsThe instructor was knowledgeable and presented security awareness a bit different than I\\'ve seen before... - Rob...I learned quite a lot of stuff I didn\\'t know. - JulieSmall course.

       "  \"說明Customer Service: Delight Your Customers with Customer CareMaster Customer Service - delight your customers using great customer care and benefit from lifelong loyalty and referralsDo your customers LOVE you? Do they rave to their friends about what a great company you are? Would they ever consider switching to a competitor? Do they always leave your premises happy and well cared for? You might think this is a faraway dream, too expensive to achieve, or simply impossible for a product/business like yours….But guess what - it’s not! Customer Service can make all of those goals come true, and doesn’t need to cost you anything except creativity and passion. Amazingly there are almost no official theories, tools or frameworks out there talking about Customer Care. For me it’s one of the most powerful and underestimated marketing, sales and leadership areas. So, I have created a step by step course you can use to come up with original, cost effective and unique ways to delight every customer and have them coming back to you time after time. Imagine if all your customers became repeat clients, and referred you to others many times over? You could fire your whole sales and marketing team! In my experience, most employees genuinely want to do a good job and make customers happy, but often don’t have the tools or empowerment to make it a reality. This course fixes that with simple, tried and tested ideas that have been working for decades. Over my 20 year management coaching career I've seen thousands of businesses... and I've pinpointed all the ways they could improve their customer service! The challenge with Customer Service is you need to be constantly ahead of your competitors and offering something unique and special to delight the customer. If you don't already have fresh Customer Service ideas popping up on a daily basis I’d highly recommend taking this course. It will allow you to build a loyal fanbase of customers who would never dream of spending their money elsewhere... and that could multiply your revenues many times over!

Have you\\'ve ever wanted to: • Invest with business partners but do so in a smart and fair way? • Want to appeal to investor clients as an agent? • Want to land an acquisitions role as an analyst/associate? • Want to get into real estate private equity and need to get up to speed? • Want to be able to ANALYZE any real estate opportunity? • Look at and evaluate deals the way a professional investor would? • Become smarter and more efficient at finding and evaluating deals than you did before? • Know what Airbnb short term rentals are all about and if it\\'s worth your effort? • Become an agent who could target investor clients instead of just home buyers? • Have professional investment analysis tools that you could use immediately to evaluate your own investment opportunities? • Get into a real estate acquisitions role (analyst or associate) in real estate i-banking or private equity (you get 20+ investment models/examples!)? IF YES to any of the above, then this course is definitely for you. Theododre Catillo - 5 Stars“Very comprehensive. Much more than I expected.

Highly recommended!” Jorge juyo - 5 Stars“The information is really well organized, well presented, Symon uses all the media and audio visual aids possible and that makes it easy to follow.”_______________________________________ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS______________________________________ I don\\'t live in the US, is the material still relevant to me? Yes! While all of the examples are using US properties, ALL of the concepts taught and tools provided are just as useful for any market around the world. In fact, I have students from over 190 countries who are learning and using the tools provided in the course to help them invest in their local area. What if I don\\'t have any real estate background? Perfect! I start you off with a heavy dose of the fundamentals so students with no experience or background can get the most out of the rest of the course. Check out my foundational sections below. I have some real estate background already, what could I learn from your course? Besides everything listed above, I’ll show you how to answer these types of questions for EVERY kind of real estate property: • How do you know if a particular investment is worth your time and money? • How do you know if property A is better than property B? • How do you find deals that make sense for you? That fit your risk preferences and goals? • How can you calculate your expected return on your investment? • How would you analyze the returns for your investment company? • How do you structure an investment with investment partners? • How do you analyze operating assets? If you know how to do all of that, this course isn’t for you. The good news I have plenty of advanced courses available as well, feel free to check those out right now to find the one that’s appropriate for your experience level. Having said that, I put A LOT of useful materials in here so you\\'re more than likely going to learn something new. I\\'ve had folks who had over 20 years of experience find something of value in this course, so I’m certain you can too. Why is there so much math and number crunching? You can\\'t properly evaluate a real estate investment without looking at its numbers. So if you hate math and don\\'t like numbers, this course isn\\'t for you. Serious real estate analysis is probably not for you either. Why do you use Excel so much? Good question. Analyzing real estate investments involves looking at the numbers and it\\'s easiest to do so with spreadsheets, which is why I use Excel extensively in this course. But the good thing is you DO NOT have to build any of the models yourself. You just need to be able to follow along and then you\\'ll be able to use the models I give you. Can you make me rich by taking your course? No, not just from taking the course. Anyone who promises you that is selling snake oil.What I can guarantee is that you will leave with some serious real estate investing knowledge and techniques that can then lead you to being more profitable with your investments. What else does this course cover besides real estate investing? This course is ALL about and ONLY about professional real estate investing analysis concepts and techniques. Nothing else. But as you can see, this topic alone offers quite a bit to cover already. Actually, I do cover one more thing: I will also cover daily affirmations that help you build that winning mindset. Oh, and I’ll have lots of sales videos that will push you to sign up for my super top secret real estate system for only 12 monthly low payments of just $999. Just kidding. What will I be able to do after I take your course? After taking my course, you will be: • Able to confidently use professional real estate investment techniques. • Able to evaluate both residential AND commercial real estate opportunities. • Able to structure investments with business partners in a smart and equitable way via the waterfall framework • Know how to identify and mitigate investment risks. What WON\\'T I get from this course? • You will not get a Real Estate License from taking this course. You can only get licensed by taking the appropriate test with the testing agency of your state and country. But what is taught in this course has nothing to with getting a license, which focuses on how to legally transact real estate deals between buyers and sellers. This course is about investment analysis. • Due to the sheer number of students, I am unfortunately unable to help you evaluate your personal investment deals in this course. This is about you learning how to do it on your own using the lessons and the tools here. If you really want me to consult with you privately, my hourly rate is $350/hr with a minimum of 20 hours per request. • This course does not cover any of the wide range of OTHER real estate topics, which deserve their own courses, including but not limited to: contract negotiations, real estate law, real estate marketing, REITs, etc... I try to cover the most important concepts as it relates to evaluating investment opportunities. Diego Ginzo - 5 stars\"Excelente. Son clarisimas las explicaciones y la conceptualizacion\"Larry Butler - 5 stars“Like the Bacchanal buffet in Las Vegas for real estate investing--a lot to devour but each is deliciously made. I\\'m already feeling full but can\\'t wait to go back for more platefuls. If you\\'re hungry and have a refined palette with respect to real estate, look no further.” What’s holding you back? Are you afraid this course won’t work? I assure you it will. Are you afraid this course will work and you’ll actually have to start investing? I think that’s a pretty good problem to have. Are you afraid it will take time and effort? It will. Real estate isn’t an easy business, if it was everyone would do it. But if you put in the work I promise you’ll see results. Best of all, there is absolutely ZERO risk. Udemy gives you a 30-day money back guarantee to ensure you get what you pay for. So go ahead, sign up and I\\'ll see you inside!~Symon此課程適合哪些人：Newbie real estate investorsExperienced commercial and/or residential real estate investorsPeople that want to invest in House Flips, Rental Properties or ApartmentsThose that want to invest in commercial warehouses, parking lots, retail properties, etc...Great for private investors and investment teamsReal Estate Agents Seeking Tools to Appeal to Investor AudienceThose who want to make BANK with AirbnbMBA Students, iBankers, Financial AnalystsSomeone who wants an in depth and broad coverage of real estate investment analysis concepts and techniques顯示更多顯示更少'],\n",

       "  '說明If you are a current or aspiring IT professional in search of sound, practical techniques to plan, design, and build a data warehouse or data mart, this is the course for you.During the course, you’ll put what you learn to work and define sample data warehousing architectures and dimensional data structures to help emphasize the best practices and techniques covered in this course. Each section has either scenario based quiz questions or hands on assignments that emphasizes key learning objectives for that section’s material. This way, you can be confident as you move through the course that you’re picking up the key points about data warehousing.To build this course, I drew from more than 30 years of my own data warehousing work on more than 40 client projects and engagements. I’ve been a thought leader in the discipline of data warehousing since the early 1990s when modern data warehousing came onto the scene. I’ve literally seen it all...and written about the discipline of data warehousing in books such as the original Data Warehousing For Dummies ® , along with articles, white papers, and as a monthly data warehousing columnist. I’ve led global consulting practices delivering data warehousing (and its related discipline, business intelligence) to some of the most recognizable brand name customers, along with smaller-sized organizations and governmental agencies. My own consulting firm, Thinking Helmet, Inc., specializes in data warehousing, business intelligence, and related disciplines. I’ve rolled up my sleeves and personally tackled every aspect of what you’ll learn in this course. I’ve even learned a few painful lessons, and have built a healthy share of “lessons learned” into the course material.In this course, I take you from the fundamentals and concepts of data warehousing all the way through best practices for the architecture, dimensional design, and data interchange that you’ll need to implement data warehousing in your organization. You’ll find many examples that clearly demonstrate the key concepts and techniques covered throughout the course. By the end of the course, you’ll be all set to not only put these principles to work, but also to make the key architecture and design decisions required by the “art” of data warehousing that transcend the nuts-and-bolts techniques and design patterns.Specifically, this course will cover:Foundational data warehousing concepts and fundamentalsThe symbiotic relationship between data warehousing and business intelligenceHow data warehousing co-exists with data lakes and data virtualizationYour many architectural alternatives, from highly centralized approaches to numerous multi-component alternativesThe fundamentals of dimensional analysis and modelingThe key relational database capabilities that you will put to work to build your dimensional data modelsDifferent alternatives for handling changing data history within your environment, and how to decide which approaches to apply in various situationsHow to organize and design your Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) capabilities to keep your data warehouse up to dateData warehousing is both an art and a science. While we have developed a large body of best practices over the years, we still have to make this-or-that types of decisions from the earliest stages of a data warehousing project all the way through architecture, design, and implementation. That’s what I’ve instilled into this course: the fusion of data warehousing art and science that you can bring to your organization and your own work. So come join me on this journey through the world of data warehousing!此課程適合哪些人：A business analyst, data engineer, or database designer, currently with little or no exposure to or experience with data warehousing, who desires to build a personal toolbox of data warehousing best practices and techniques.After completing this course, you will be ready to begin working on real-world data warehousing projects, either with expanded responsibilities as part of an existing role or to find a new position involving data warehousing. Example positions include data warehousing architect, dimensional data modeler, ETL architect and designer, and data warehousing business analyst.顯示更多顯示更少'],\n",

       "  '說明Business Analysts have a wide range of feelings about Agile. Some love it. It’s a fast and nimble way to develop products, and you can be very productive in relatively little time. Others hate it, because it is radically different from traditional control-oriented project approaches, and they struggle to understand their value and role when documentation takes a back seat. And many others like the idea of Agile, but realize that it’s a tricky thing to get right – especially with very large organizations which have documentation and processes deeply engrained in their cultures. If any of these statements sounds familiar, we designed this course for you. There is a lot of training out there for agile teams, but agile BAs have very specific needs that haven’t been addressed… (until now) That’s why we developed this course – to give you a basis on which to build an excellent BA career in any agile environment. In this clear, concise, and easy-to-follow course, you will learn: How to figure out what your role on the team needs to be What user stories and acceptance criteria really are – and it’s probably not what you think When to write requirements to maximize efficiency and minimize re-work Why the traditional product backlog is a mess and how to overcome it What a typical BA does in the course of a day, sprint, and release (and a whole lot more) … all while learning the ropes from a seasoned expert and business analysis executive. By the end of the course, you’ll have more than just knowledge… You’ll have the practice and practical experience you need to feel confident on the job. 此課程適合哪些人：Business Analysts who are moving onto an agile team for the first timeBusiness Analysts who want to be successful in agile environmentsNew Product Owners顯示更多顯示更少'],\n",

       "  \"說明Conflict and disagreements are a natural part of everyday life as there is not enough of what everyone wants to go around. Conflict occurs over money, goods, services, power, possessions, time, and much more.If something exists and more than one person wants or needs it, there is a potential for conflict to occur.Conflict occurs all the time - at home, at work, between individuals, in teams, in groups, in tribes and between nations. Where there are people, there is conflict. This is underpinned by how people are using their emotional intelligence.Some disagreement and conflict is inevitable as this where learning, creativity, and understanding occurs. It is not that conflict occurs that is the issue, it is how it is managed. This course is about proactively working together with others in ways that will help you to communicate more efficiently as you work with them to understand and work with differences that lead to conflict. In addition, the skills, processes and tools taught in this course can bring value to other aspects of your life.Negotiating and resolving conflict requires good use of emotional intelligence - your ability to balance your emotional needs with your thinking. Managing conflict involves using skills such as rapport, empathy and listening.Conflict modes and styles are reviewed looking at the strengths and liabilities of each. You get the chance to complete a questionnaire that will give you an insight to the mode / style that you prefer to use in conflict situations. Completing this practical activity will enable you to identify ways to reframe and defuse conflict, creating more productive outcomes and results.The course, also, covers flexibility and how you use behavioural preferences around working with time. Your flexibility and adaptability underpins how you work with change and can have a profound impact on others that could lead to conflict. By completing this course, you will be able toIdentify what conflict is about and how people react to conflictRecognize why some conflict is to be expected and why it is a part of healthy relationshipsCompare and contrast the various modes that can be used in conflict resolutionAssess your own mode of conflict and how this helps or hinders you in working with conflictExplain how emotional responses differentiate from rational responses in conflictDetermine your behavioural preferences around managing and working with time and how they impact upon your flexibilityDevelop strategies for dealing with conflict and have some ideas about how to resolve difficultiesDiscover how emotional intelligence is used to resolve conflict and build emotional bondsThis course is a standalone course for anyone interested in understanding how to manage, work with and resolve conflict.

It forms part of our advanced emotional intelligence course endorsed by the Institute of Leadership and Management.PLEASE NOTE - This course is NOT for you if you are not prepared to work through the exercises that make up a fundamental part of the course. Conflict cannot be managed just by watching the video lectures. It requires you to do some reflective thinking, to get some feedback and to discuss your development with others. I'm afraid that you won't get the best from the course unless you are prepared to do this.There are SEVEN practical activities included within the course that are designed to help you understand conflict management.

So much stress I couldn't leave it behind, even for a few hours, to really enjoy time with my family. Does this sentence sound familiar? “Your here but you are not really here.” I get it.Difficult people SUCK!I have screamed at the top of my lungs, in my car, while back fisting the passenger seat headrest to the point I’ve ripped the skin off my knuckles. I even purchased a new mattress and pillow thinking that it might actually help me sleep through the night. It didn’t work. I still didn’t sleep well and the stress just kept building.I’ve purchased Melatonin (sleep aid) even when it wasn’t on a Buy One Get One sale. I can also find the bottle of Tylenol PM in complete darkness at 02:00 AM. I've walked away from jobs, that I've loved, due to a boss being so unreasonably difficult I just couldn't put my job in front of my health any longer. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this, but there must be some sort of science that explains why the air instantly seems fresher the moment you choose to walk (or run) away from a toxic situation.Difficult people are just unhealthy. I’ve skipped meals because I was too stressed to eat which usually resulted in me hitting a drive-through just because “I just need something.” 40+ pounds later…”Well, this isn’t working for me.” I get it.Difficult people have caused me to be physically sick. I've felt physical back pain because I was so stressed out and tense knowing that I was going to be dealing with difficult co-workers tomorrow.Let me ask a couple more questions:What would it feel like to sleep peacefully throughout the night?Wouldn't it be great to have a few key strategies that make dealing with difficult people a lot easier? What would it feel like to have control of the situation?What would it feel like to be able to leave work behind and enjoy your evening, your weekend, or even your vacation?What would it feel like to actually “Look forward to work tomorrow”?What would it feel like to have the power to “Fire” that one difficult customer that takes up so much of your time, your thoughts, and your work?What if dealing with difficult people actually becomes a fun game you become really good at playing?Once I began to master these strategies, the air became fresher, my sleep improved, and I became healthier and happier. By the end of this course, you will have 12 different strategies that will help you better deal with difficult people.By mastering the strategies and tactics of this course you will be able to:Improve your safetyIncrease your overall level of professionalismReduce your stress levelImprove your moraleDecrease the number of complaints you may receiveLower your personal liability All of this adds up to a healthier and happier personal and professional life. This could mean greater productivity for you, employees, and fellow co-workers which would likely increase profitability. For example, what would your office be like if everyone just “got along” with one another? This course is primarily a series of video lectures that outline the strategies. The lectures contain personal stories and real-life examples of how I've used these strategies and tactics in my career in law enforcement, customer service, sales, and life in general.This course was designed specifically for individuals and employees, who work in a professional environment that is often unpleasant due to difficult co-workers, supervisors, customers and/or clients. It’s about taking control of the situation instead of being controlled by the situation.Students from all around the world (over 90 different countries - This just blows me away!) are studying the 12 Strategies and learning how to deal with difficult people.I’m honored and humbled by those who have reached to me to share their personal success stories using these strategies. It’s heartwarming to know this course is really making a difference for so many people from around the world.

       "  \"說明How effective are you at working with other people in small groups or in larger teams?How good are you at communicating and building effective relationships?How are you working with the emotional intelligence of your team and developing emotional intelligence in the workplace?The increasing complexity of teamwork in the 21st century means that teams are unlikely to achieve superior performance through chance or the skills of an effective team leader. What matters is how the team manages the emotional climate under which they are working - in other words, effectively managing emotional intelligence in the workplace.This course is about proactively working together with others in ways that will help you to communicate more efficiently as you engage with each other to bring value to your company and your customers. In addition, the emotional intelligence skills, processes and tools taught in this course can bring value to other aspects of your life.People often talk about positive and negative emotions. This is not that helpful as emotions cannot really be labelled in that way. The course also covers the myths around positive and negative emotions and why this terminology is not appropriate when working to understand emotions and emotional intelligence in the workplace. Good team working means that you can understand how each other works together. It means that you can have an understanding of other people's strengths and limitations through the way in which they use they prefer to approach situations, their focus and their behaviour. The course, also, covers working with the emotions experienced during change and ways to develop resilience in individuals, teams and organisations.Some disagreement and conflict will be inevitable as this is where learning, creativity and understanding occurs. It is not that conflict occurs that is the issue, it is how it is managed by the individuals involved, the team and the leader. The course is based around the outer world component of emotional intelligence focusing on empathy and social skills. This course is a standalone course for anyone interested in understanding how to work more effectively with others within teams. It compliments other courses that explore emotional intelligence in more depth.The course covers the DISC model looking at the behaviours of Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Compliance and how these work together in teams. You get the opportunity to look at the four behavioural styles and how you can work better with others who have a different style to your own. Completing the assessment to determine your own DISC style, will enable you to have a better understanding of your preferences and focus and how these differ from your team co-workers.You'll receive all the information that you need and will be coached using loads of practical hints that you can use straight away.The course is made up of a series of lectures and contains comprehensive course notes. There are a series of interactive exercises that involve some activity with other people and some reflection.The course material makes up a one to two day workshop so is equivalent to 8 -12 hour's training. It forms part of our advanced emotional intelligence course endorsed by the Institute of Leadership and Management.PLEASE NOTE - This course is NOT for you if you are not prepared to work through the practical activities that make up a fundamental part of the course. Team working cannot be developed just by watching the video lectures. It requires you to do some reflective thinking, to get some feedback and to discuss your development with others. I'm afraid that you won't get the best from the course unless you are prepared to do this.There are SEVEN practical activities included within the course that are designed to help you and your team to develop your team working capabilities. These areReflecting about this Course on TeamsAssessing the Dynamics of your TeamTeam Emotional Intelligence ChecklistExploring Emotional Hot ButtonsAssessing your Behavioural Style Your Least Preferred StyleReview your LearningAll of these practical activities require you to engage with your team and do some work outside of the course.

Over the past two decades, I have worked in the cybersecurity and information technology realm, fighting for my projects to be funded. Early in my career, I didn't understand why certain projects would be funded and executed, while others wouldn't. What I learned, is that it all came down to Risk Management by our executives and managers.You will learn the terms used by executives and managers in discussing Risk Management, and how to apply the concepts of Risk Management to your networks, systems, and projects. This course is not an operational or tactical course that focuses on how you will secure your networks, but instead focuses on the mindset of managers and teaches you how to think like they do. Once you master these concepts, it is much easier to build your business case for your projects and justify your budgetary needs.Throughout this course, we will discuss what comprises Risk (assets, threats, and vulnerabilities), providing numerous real-world examples along the way. We will also cover Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Measurements, showing how you can calculate the risk of an uncertainty due to vulnerabilities and threats.This course also includes two case studies of what happens when risk management fails, as demonstrated by the Amazon Web Services outage and Equifax data breach that both occurred in 2017. You will learn to better understand these scenarios, what caused the outage/breach, and why managers may have made the decisions they did that led up to them.Upon completion of this course, you will earn 3 CEUs towards the renewal of your CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, CySA+, or CASP+ certifications.此課程適合哪些人：Information Technology mangersCybersecurity managersAspiring managers顯示更多顯示更少\"],\n",
