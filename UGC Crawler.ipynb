He is an exceptional teacher and guides you through attacking the RUBRIC scale ; the scale that defines your score on the IELTS exam. This course teaches you how to reach a higher band score even if your English level is not as high as a native speaker by just tackling the scoring system. Mr. Campbell is an amazing teacher and I can assure you this course will help you achieve your dream of a score that is 7+.  P.S - Don't bother reading the negative comments about the need to have all the books, the smart among you will always find a away to get all the required books. Wake up people this is 2021 if you need a book all you got to do is search for it and you will find with ease, haha. All the best to all of you who read my comment and are giving the IELTS test and thanks again Mr Keino Campbell\",\n",
